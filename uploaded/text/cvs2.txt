hello today we're hearing CVS I mean here today to shop for some vitamins and probiotics I take these on a daily schedule maintain a healthy lifestyle %HESITATION previously I've tried the scummy probiotics but they don't I don't really enjoy the east of them %HESITATION chalky almost I said today I'm actually gonna try the digestive advantage %HESITATION previously when I am gone with the company probiotics I I did it simply because of the price difference it's two dollars cheaper for dummies but that since I didn't enjoy it I mean I tried the %HESITATION chocolate chewing on these things hopefully have a bit better flavor %HESITATION I think I like it bag more as well it just feels nicer other than that I'm just hoping these taste better than the previous ones there's I haven't tried the CVS health brand probiotics I'm not sure I will we'll see based on my opinion of these ones but thanks for listening
